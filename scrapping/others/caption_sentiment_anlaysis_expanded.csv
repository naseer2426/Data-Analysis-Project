"16","Your next challenge (Thanks to @mojorojo) ! A lot of us thought with the extra time on our hands we should pick up an instrument. You don’t have one at home? That doesn’t mean you can’t create music!
So for your next #5StarDoNothingOutside challenge, create a piece of music using only household objects (glasses, spoons, buckets, plates, your grandma, rubber bands, combs, bells, coins, etc). Create the most creative, fun, unique music (it could be a cover of an exciting song as well) to win chocolates + 10,000 bucks worth of grocery vouchers.

Ps: People who make “we will rock you” thumping music will immediately be disqualified and automatically regarded as a disappointment to their family.","0.574","0.285","0.14"

Dilli aur mumbai ke beech zindagi poori badal gayi par aapse rishta nahi badla. Mujhe yaad hai humari dosti ki shuruwat hui jab ek din kisi open mic ke baad baaton baaton me aapne aise hi mazak me kaha tha ki tu aise perform karta hai jaise apne ghar ke sofe pe betha ho. Woh baat mere liye apne kaam ko pehchanne ke liye bahut kargar sabit hui.
2011 Se 2020 tak aapko dekha hai, aapse seekha hai bahut kuch. Aapse bade bhai wala sneh aur dost wali imaandari humesha ek sath mili hai.
@jokesingh bhai shukriya mujhe 2014 me mera pehle 1 hour perform karne ka mauka dene ke liye. Uss 320 seat wale show me sirf 19 tickets bechne ke bawajud show cancel nahi karne ke liye shukriya. Shukriya naukri ke dauran mahine ke aakhiri dino me udhar dene ke liye. Mere late aane ki aadat par nahi datne ke liye shukriya. Aap hustler ho yeh sab jante hain, par uss hustle ke liye jo risk aap lete ho woh shayad hi koi samajhta ho. Kash mai woh aapse seekh paun kabhi. Zindagi ki long drive me gaadi chahe aap chala lena par mai bas sath rehna chahta hoon chips aur cold-drinks liye.
Akhri baat, shukriya @jokesingh bhai rishte nibhana seekhane ke liye.","0.555","0.305","0.14"

______________________________________

Video calls are apparently part of our lives now. When they were first introduced, I assumed it would be the most popular form of communication but I guess it never really caught on till a pandemic struck the whole planet. Thanks to technology, seeing and hearing each other has become so simple...well we still can’t smell each other (thank god). I mean it could have been worse, we could have had no internet.
This Easter, I hope you are close to your family through technology as we get through this together.

"115","The love,
The sacrifices you’ve made,
The compromises you conceal,
The meaning you add to my life,
The happiness you bring to my system,
The smile that you ensure on days of all kinds,
The very existence of YOU in my world is a blessing.
You are my baby n you’ll be that even when you are a 100 years old.
You have to be me, to know how much I love you!
Today is a reminder, of how lucky I’m to have you in my life.
Happy birthday monkey😘❤️","0.072","0.262","0.667"
